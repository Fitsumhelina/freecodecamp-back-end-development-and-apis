# FreeCodeCamp Back End Development and APIs

## Overview

This repository contains projects and code examples from the FreeCodeCamp Back End Development and APIs course. The course covers various aspects of back-end development, including building APIs, handling databases, and managing server-side operations.

## Course Objectives

- Understand the basics of back-end development.
- Learn to create and manage RESTful APIs.
- Work with databases to store and retrieve data.
- Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Integrate third-party services and APIs.

## Projects

This repository includes the following projects from the course:

1. **week 1: [ Managing Packages with NPM ]**
   - **Description:** npm (Node Package Manager), is a command line tool to install, create, and share packages of JavaScript code written for Node.js. There are many open source packages available on npm, so before starting a project, take some time to explore so you don't end up recreating the wheel for things like working with dates or fetching data from an API..
   - **Technologies Used:** javascript , json.
   

2. **week 2: [Basic Node and Express]**
   - **Description:** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to write backend (server-side) programs in JavaScript. Node.js comes with a handful of built-in modules — small, independent programs — that help with this. Some of the core modules include HTTP, which acts like a server, and File System, a module to read and modify files..
   - **Technologies Used:** node.js , expess.js , javascript.
   - **Instructions:** How to run or test the project.

3. **week 3: [MongoDB and Mongoose]**
   - **Description:** MongoDB is a database application that stores JSON documents (or records) that you can use in your application. Unlike SQL, another type of database, MongoDB is a non-relational or "NoSQL" database. This means MongoDB stores all associated data within one record, instead of storing it across many preset tables as in a SQL database..
   - **Technologies Used:** express.js, node.js , mongoos, mongoDB.
   - **Instructions:** How to run or test the project.
